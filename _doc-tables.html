These jobs also required TiDB nodes to allocate local disk space for sorting, before loading to TiKV.<br/>With the introduction of the Global Sorting feature in v7.4.0, data is temporarily stored in external shared storage (S3 in this version) for global sorting before being loaded into TiKV. This eliminates the need for TiKV to consume extra resources and significantly improves the performance and stability of operations like <code>ADD INDEX</code> and <code>IMPORT INTO</code>.</td>

TiDB v7.4.0 applies this control to background tasks as well. In v7.4.0, Resource Control now identifies and manages the resources produced by background tasks, such as auto-analyze, Backup & Restore, bulk load with TiDB Lightning, and online DDL.
